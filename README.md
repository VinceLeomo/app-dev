My first repository
**The 100**
*The show frequently explored and portrayed sensitive topics like loss. Loss and sacrifice were unfortunately common themes in this post-apocalyptic world, and the impact that death and grief had on the characters was realistically conveyed throughout all seasons.*
**My Favorite Characters are:**
1. Bellamy Blake
2. Monty Green
3. Raven Reyes
